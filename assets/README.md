Rebuild everything (deterministic): `bun assets/src/build.ts`. It prints the byte budget.
- Avatars are role-letter templates in `src/avatars.ts`. Room pieces in `src/room.ts` are ray-cast from
  3D boxes by `src/iso.ts`, so every edge sits on the exact 2:1 grid. Palette ramps are in `src/palette.ts`.
- The build fails if an avatar touches its cell border, or if a frame id repeats across sets (Pixi caches textures by key).

## Avatar atlas (PixiJS v8 native spritesheet JSON, TexturePacker "hash" style)

```ts
const sheet = await Assets.load("…/avatars/avatars.json"); // Spritesheet
sheet.textureSource.scaleMode = "nearest";
const s = new Sprite(sheet.textures["kiki/sit/sw/0"]); // anchor comes from the atlas
s.position.set(seatTileCenter.x, seatTileCenter.y);
```

- **Layout:** one row per avatar (`juno`, `pip`, `mo`, `kiki`, top to bottom). Each row has 12 cells, 32×64,
  with no trimming and no rotation. Per pose (`idle`, then `sit`), the order is
  `se/0, se/1, sw/0, sw/1, ne/0, nw/0`. The web never relies on this order; it reads the rects.
- **Frame key:** `<avatarId>/<pose>/<dir>/<n>`, where pose is `idle|sit` and dir is `se|sw|ne|nw`.
  n is `0` (open eyes) or `1` (blink).
- **Back views** (`ne`, `nw`) face away from the camera, toward the TV, and are what seated viewers use.
  Their `/1` key points at the **same rect** as `/0` (no eyes from behind), so the blink ticker needs no special case.
  Seat facing rule: `col < row` → `ne`, otherwise `nw`.
- **`animations`:** `<avatarId>/<pose>/<dir>` → `[…/0, …/1]`. This is **not** a loop. Show `1` for about 120 ms every
  3–6 s, with random jitter per avatar (`meta.omega.blink`).
- **Per-frame `anchor` = floor point** `(0.5, 0.953125)`, i.e. pixel (16, 61). For `idle` it's the feet.
  For `sit` it's the floor under the hips, so you place the sprite at the **seat tile centre**. Seats
  are drawn with their surface 8 px above that point (`meta.omega.seatHeight`).
- **`meta.omega`:** `tile {64×32}`, `cell`, `floorPoint`, `seatHeight`, `poses`, `dirs`, `blink`, and
  `avatars[] {id, label, blurb, colors {main, dark}}` (use `colors.main` for nickname tags and the picker).
- Status: accepted, see `docs/adr/0004-sprite-atlas-format.md`. `meta.format` is informational (PixiJS v8 ignores it); the PNG is indexed PNG-8.

## Room atlas (`room/room.json`, same format)

**Every frame's anchor is the floor point of the cell it belongs to:** the tile centre, `cellCenter(col,row)`
in `apps/web/src/layout.ts`. Place the sprite there, with no per-item offsets.

| Key | Size | Place at | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `floor/0`, `floor/1` | 64×32 | every floor cell | Honey planks. Tiles partition pixels half-open, so they tessellate with no gaps or overlaps. |
| `rug/<c\|ne\|se\|sw\|nw\|n\|e\|s\|w>` | 64×32 | rug cells | 9-slice. Parts name the screen side of the rug rim; edge tiles include the floor planks outside the rug. |
| `wall/l/<plain\|window0\|window1\|sconce>` | 39×233 | `(0,row)` | Stands on the cell's top-left edge. `window0` at row r needs `window1` at r+1. |
| `wall/r/<plain\|poster0\|poster1\|sconce>` | 39×233 | `(col,0)` | Stands on the cell's top-right edge. `poster0` at col c needs `poster1` at c+1. |
| `wall/corner` | | `(0,0)` | Top cap of the back corner. |
| `wall/l/end`, `wall/r/end` | | `(0,9)`, `(9,0)` | Open wall ends at the front. |
| `armchair/<ne\|nw>/back`, `…/front` | 52×36 | seat cell | Draw `back`, then the seated avatar, then `front`. Seat surface is 8 px above the anchor (`seatHeight`). |
| `tv/0` | 347×253 | `(0,0)` | Corner media console + wall-mounted TV + dithered glow. The screen is painted "off"; `meta.omega.tv.screen` is the iframe rect. |
| `plant/0`, `lamp/0` | | any free cell | Floor props. |

- **Walls** tile as flat 32 px columns, and only their top edge is outlined, so segments butt with no seams. Draw floor → walls → `tv/0`
  as one static background (it never changes, so it can be cached into a single texture).
- **Z order** for everything else: sort by `(floorY, floorX, layer)` with `meta.omega.layers`
  (`back 2`, `avatar 3`, `front 4`).
- **`meta.omega.tv.screen = {x:-160, y:-212, w:320, h:180}`**, relative to the `tv/0` anchor. With the anchor at
  `cellCenter(0,0)` = (480,236), this is exactly today's `TV` rect in `layout.ts`.
- **The console covers the back corner cells** `col+row <= 1` (and the back half of `col+row = 2`). Don't seat or stand anyone there.
- **`meta.omega.layout`** is a suggested default room for the 10×10 floor: `floor[row][col]` keys, `walls.l[row]`,
  `walls.r[col]`, `props[]`. Seats are **not** in it; they stay in `layout.ts`. `preview/room@1x.png` renders exactly this layout
  with the `layout.ts` seats.
